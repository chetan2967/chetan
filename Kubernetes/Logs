Logs:

kubectl logs <pod-name>

-f               : Use the -f (follow) flag for Streaming Logs in Real-Time
<container-name> : For a specific container in a pod
--all-containers : For logs from all containers in a pod
--since=1h	     : View logs for a specific time range

kubectl logs -l app=<app_label> : View logs across multiple pods (with label selectors)

Aggregated Logs with Logging Systems
For large-scale Kubernetes clusters, managing logs directly from pods can be inefficient. Use centralized logging solutions to collect, store, and analyze logs.

Popular Kubernetes Logging Tools:
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):
Collect and index logs with Logstash.
Store logs in Elasticsearch.
Visualize and analyze logs in Kibana.

Fluentd/Fluent Bit:
Used to forward logs to various backends like Elasticsearch, Splunk, or cloud logging services.

Promtail with Loki (Grafana):
Promtail collects logs and sends them to Loki.
Loki stores logs efficiently, and you can visualize them with Grafana.

Cloud Provider Logging:
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): Use Google Cloud Logging.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS): Use CloudWatch.
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Use Azure Monitor.
